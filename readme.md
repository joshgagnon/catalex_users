# CataLex User Management Portal

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joshgagnon/catalex_users.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joshgagnon/catalex_users)

This app provides users, organisations and global admins an interface to manage their own (and others) user and billing details. It also provides login support for the Law Browser.

## Deployment

### Local Dev Copy

1. Install composer `curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | sudo php -- --install-dir=/usr/bin`
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the blanks
1. Create a new database called `catalex_users`
1. Use composer to install PHP dependencies `composer install`
1. Install JS dependencies `npm install`
1. Install gulp globally `npm install -g gulp`
1. Migrate the DB`php artisan migrate`
1. Seed the DB`php artisan db:seed --seeder=DevelopmentSeeder`


## Tests

`./vendor/bin/phpunit`

### Options

**Log testing stats:** `--log-junit=log_name.xml`

**Run specific test:** `--filter=test_class_name_or_test_name`

## Deploying Live

To perform the initial deployment on a live server, clone the https://github.com/joshgagnon/catalex_utils.git repo. Edit the variables at the top of the install\_users.sh script then run it as root.

### OAuth

#### OAuth for logging into other CataLex services

For each service that needs to authenticate with CataLex, add a client and an endpoint for that client (example below).

The `--name="whatever"` is importantâ€”we match on it to find the right oauth_client record. For Good Companies the name is "Good Companies", for Law Browser the name is "Law Browser", and for sign the name is "Sign".

`php artisan oauth:add-client --client_id=gc --secret=gc --name="Good Companies"`

`php artisan oauth:add-endpoint --client_id=gc --endpoint=http://localhost:5667/auth/catalex/login`

#### OAuth for logging into CataLex Users

Currently the only OAuth provider setup is LinkedIn. For LinkedIn OAuth to work, it's ket and secret need to be entered into a new file `config/oauth.php`. Use `config/oauth.example.php` as an example.

### Updating Live

Live installations can be updated with the following command:

    sudo ./update.sh www-data

It must be run as root and provide the webserver username to avoid file permission errors. It will pull updates from git, apply migrations and update dependencies, so the application may be in the 'down' status for a few minutes.

## Development

### Generic Functionality

To add non-model specific, non-controller functionality to the app, the best place is `app/Library`. Functionality that won't need to be mocked for testing should be made as a static function directly accessible on in a library class. Testable functions should not be static, even if they require no state - instead use non-static methods and add a class binding in `App\Providers\AppServiceProvider`.

### Emails

All emails must pass through a css inliner before being sent, so do not use the laravel provided `Mail` class directly but instead use `App\Library\Mail`. To create an new email, extend the `emails.ink-template` view and use a table-based layout as describe by the [Zurb Ink documentation](http://zurb.com/ink/docs.php).

### User Scope

When using the `User` model, note that it has an applied scope which filters out inactive users in the same way the default `SoftDelete` scope does. The scope adds a `withInactive()` builder method equivalent to the Laravel `withTrashed()`. They can be used together to retrieve a user who was made inactive before being deleted.


## Create new service

`php artisan tinker`

`App\Service::create(['name' => 'CataLex Sign', 'is_paid_service' => true]);`

# Todo

Upgrade to Laravel 5.5 LTS.

Move out all authorisation logic (eg. checking if a user is a global admin) from controllers to middleware applied in the routes file.

Dead code elimination.

Consistent styling of pages.

Better, more intuitive navigation between pages. Construct Information Architecture first, so it is well thought out.

Fix footer - it looks weird.

Better documentation.

More consistent use of Laravel features, eg. Route Model Binding, using $request->user() instead of facade, etc.

Create code style and bring all code into new code style.

Clean up billing simulation tests.

Move to new Laravel OAuth.

Use the OAuth classes for service based api auth, instead of looking in the db for the secret to match.

# To add new billing item

1. Add new item type to database constraint:
    1. Create a DB migration to add the new item type name to the billing item type constraint. See `2018_02_08_194348_add_court_costs_to_billing_item_types`.
    1. Otherwise just drop this constraint all together.
    1. Use this migration to also add the service to the database, see `2018_02_13_230335_add_court_costs_serivce.php`.
    1. Run the migration.
1. In `app/BillingItem.php`:
    1. Add `const ITEM_TYPE_WHATEVER = 'item_type_whatever'`. This is what it is saved in the DB as and must add what was added in the DB constraint.
    1. Add that to `$itemTypes`.
    1. Add a case to the switch in the function `description()`. This is used on the invoice.
1. Wire up the new stats
    1. Add the new billing item to `AdminController`'s `stats()` function in `app/Http/Controllers/AdminController.php`.
    1. Add the new stat item the the template `resources/views/admin/stats.blade.php`.
    1. Alternatively, make this all more generic.
1. Send email for sign up:
    1. In `SubscriptionController`'s `update()` method, see where other services are checking if they need to send an email, and add for the new service.
    1. You will also need to create an email template, see how other services do this in the same method.
1. Add pricing:
    1. In `config/constants.php` add monthly and yearly pricing.
    1. In `app/Models/Billable.php`'s `priceForBillingItem()` method, add a new switch case for the new billing item.
1. Add ability for subscription to be added as a monthly or yearly billing item payment:
    1. In `app/Service.php` add `const SERVICE_NAME_WHATEVER = 'Whatever'`.
    1. In `app/User`'s `syncSubscriptionsWithBillingItems()` method, add the new service type to the `$serviceTypeMappings` array.
1. Update the 'Edit Subscription' views (the first for organisations, the second individuals):
    1. `resources/views/subscriptions/org/edit.blade.php`
    1. `resources/views/service-user/edit.blade.php`
1. Add to the home page `resources/views/user/home.blade.php`.
1. TEST IT!
1. Ask me why my instructions didn't work.

**Lots of this could be done way nicer with a bit of TLC:**

* stats could be more generic.
* descriptions could be in a config file and have no need for a switch.
* syncSubscriptionsWithBillingItems could be in a config file rather than code.
* `SubscriptionController->update()` could be way way way nicer and easier to add to - could even be based on a config file.
* other such improvements.
